# Hi, I'm Felix 

I'm a C/C++ software developer transitioning into **Cloud Engineering**.  
This site is my public learning log - a place to document what I build and understand along the way.

## What you'll find here
- Short, practical notes on **Kubernetes, Docker, Go, Python and other**
- Build logs from my portfolio projects
- “Gotchas” I’ve hit and how I fixed them
- Checklists and commands I want to remember

## Topics
- [Cloud Computing](./cloud_computing.md)
- [Docker](./docker.md)
- [Kubernetes](./kubernetes.md)
- [Terraform (Coming soon)](./terraform.md)
- [Linux](./linux.md)
- [Go](./go.md)
- [Python](./python.md)

## Why I’m writing this
Explaining things forces me to truly understand them.  
If this helps someone else starting the same journey, even better.

## Next posts (coming soon)
