# Felix — Linux Internals & System Programming

This site contains notes and experiments around **Linux internals** and **C/C++ system programming**.  
It serves as a personal reference built from reading source code, running experiments, and documenting observations.

## Topics

### Execution
Process creation, scheduling, signals, and program lifecycle.

→ [Execution](./execution.md)

---

### Memory
Virtual memory behavior and how it becomes visible in user space.

→ [Memory](./memory.md)

---

### I/O
Interaction between user space, the kernel, and the storage stack.

→ [I/O](./io.md)

---

### Filesystems
Persistent storage, consistency, and crash behavior.

→ [Filesystems](./filesystems.md)

---

### Interfaces
Kernel interfaces exposed to user space and how they are used.

→ [Interfaces](./interfaces.md)

---

### Concurrency
Parallel execution and coordination in system software.

→ [Concurrency](./concurrency.md)

---

### Isolation
Kernel mechanisms for separation and resource control.

→ [Isolation](./isolation.md)

---

### Failure
Common failure modes in low-level software.

→ [Failure](./failure.md)

---

### Tooling
Tools and techniques for observing system behavior.

→ [Tooling](./tooling.md)

---

### C / C++
Language-level notes and observations from practical use.

→ [C / C++](./c_cpp.md)

---

## Projects
Small experiments used to verify assumptions and document behavior.

→ [Projects](./projects.md)
