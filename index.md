# Hi, I'm Felix 👋

I'm a C/C++ software developer transitioning into **Cloud Engineering**.  
This site is my public learning log - a place to document what I build and understand along the way.

## What you'll find here
- Short, practical notes on **Kubernetes, Docker, Go, Python and other**
- Build logs from my portfolio projects
- “Gotchas” I’ve hit and how I fixed them
- Checklists and commands I want to remember

## Current focus
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Go
- Python
- Cloud Computing
- Linux

## Why I’m writing this
Explaining things forces me to truly understand them.  
If this helps someone else starting the same journey, even better.

## Next posts (coming soon)
